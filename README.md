	 <p> You've probably heard it from your mother over a million times, but
		making your bed every morning is a must. This makes your entire bedroom look
		neater and more organized, and slipping between the sheets will seem far more
		inviting come bedtime. Making your bed may sound like a simple task, but doing
		it neatly and correctly actually involves a little know-how. So start with Step
		1 below to learn how to make a bed perfectly.

		<li>
		  <b>Making Your Bed</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> Whether you're making
				your bed after getting up in the morning or after washing your sheets, the
				first thing to do is to clear the bed. Be sure to take off pillows. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Put the fitted sheet on</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> If the fitted sheet is
				not already on the bed, you will need to put it on. Do this by tucking the
				elasticated ends of the sheet around the corners of the mattress. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Put the top sheet on</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> Take the top sheet and
				spread it over the bottom sheet. Remember that the side with the large hem
				should go at the top of the bed and the hem should be aligned with the head of
				the mattress. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Make hospital corners</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> The term "hospital
				corner" refers to a specific method of folding the end of the top sheet tightly
				under the mattress. It is the trickiest step in making a bed, but is also the
				part which will make your bed look neatest. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Place the comforter on top</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> Once the top sheets is
				tucked in place, you can lay your blankets comforter on top. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Fold the top sheet and comfort down</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> Take the edge of the
				top sheet at the head of the bed and neatly fold it back over the top edge of
				the duvet, blanket or comforter. Notice how you can see the pattern on the
				inside of the sheet now. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Fluff the pillows</b> 
		  <ul> 
			 <li> Grab your pillows and
				give them a good fluffing before you place them of the bed. To fluff a pillow,
				grab it on either side and squeeze the sides together before releasing. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <b>Add the finishing touches</b> 
		<ul> 
			 <li> To finish it off, take any
		  decorative cushions or pillows you might have and place them in an upright
		  position at the head of the bed, leaning against the sleeping pillows for
		  support.
